# Anime Expo (AX) Attendance Forecast

## Intro

Society for Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA)

Two **business questions** will be addressed in this analysis:

1. What will AX attendance look like in future years?
2. What are some recommendations that can be provided to SPJA due to issues caused by AX's increasing attendance over the past few years?

## Data Extraction & Cleaning

Because SPJA releases attendance numbers for AX primarily through external sources (ie. news media), there was no clean dataset that I could obtain attendance numbers from. Attendance data was acquired from two data sources:

- [AnimeCons.com](https://animecons.com/events/info/19555/anime-expo-2023) - manually entered into Excel as a CSV

Additional notes:

- Any years with no attendance numbers recorded were removed since a forecast will be performed later. This applies to the last four years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022). 2023 was the most recent convention, so there has been no official confirmation on attendance yet.
- A majority of attendance records are estimates.
