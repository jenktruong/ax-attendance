## Intro

![Anime Expo](https://www.anime-expo.org/) is a large anime and manga convention hosted in Southern California every year since 1992 by the Society for Promotion of Japanese Animation (SPJA). Large crowds of Japanese pop culture fans are regularly attracted to this convention due to its large network of animation studios and industry insiders, variety of events and activities, artist shops, and cosplay gatherings. Notable celebrity guests from both domestic and international (mostly Japan) markets are invited to guest host panels or hold autograph signings for fans. Despite AX's notable spotlight in modern society, it historically has issues regarding crowd management, staffing, and other logistics regarding the venue (Los Angeles Convention Center) itself. The latest AX this year (2023) was no exception to this, and news articles and social media are forecasting these problems becoming worse in future years.

Two **business questions** will be addressed in this analysis:

1. What will AX attendance look like in future years?
2. What are some recommendations that can be provided to SPJA due to issues caused by AX's increasing attendance over the past few years?

## Data Extraction & Cleaning

Because SPJA releases attendance numbers for AX primarily through external sources (ie. news media), there was no clean dataset that I could obtain attendance numbers from. Attendance data was acquired from two data sources:

- [AnimeCons.com](https://animecons.com/events/info/19555/anime-expo-2023) - manually entered into Excel as a CSV

Additional notes:

- Any years with no attendance numbers recorded were removed since a forecast will be performed later. This applies to the last four years (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022). 2023 was the most recent convention, so there has been no official confirmation on attendance yet.
- A majority of attendance records are estimates.
